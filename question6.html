    Question 6:

    Write a program that simulates a shopping cart:

    Ask the user to input the total amount.

    Use a ternary operator to apply a 15% discount if the total is over $150; otherwise, apply no discount.

    Use assignment operators to update the total amount after the discount and log the final price.


</h3>

<h3>open console for output</h3>
<script>
  // question 6

let totalAmount = prompt("Enter the total : ");
let eligible ;
totalAmount >= 150 ? eligible = true : eligible = false;
totalAmount >= 150 ? console.log("discount applied") : console.log("discount not applied");
 
let discount = 15/100 * totalAmount;

eligible ? console.log(`amount after discount ${totalAmount-discount}`) : console.log("total amount less than 150");

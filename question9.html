    Question 9:

    Create a program that evaluates a person’s eligibility for a loan. The program should:

    Ask for the person’s age, salary, and credit score.

    Use logical operators (&&, ||) to check if the person is eligible for a loan (e.g., age ≥ 21, salary > $30,000,
    or credit score > 650).

    Log whether the person is approved or denied based on these conditions.



</h3>

<h3>open console for output</h3>
<script>
  // question 9

let age = prompt("Enter the age");
let salary = prompt("Enter the salary");
let creditScore = prompt("Enter the credit score ");


if(age >= 21){
  if(salary > 30000){
    if(creditScore > 650){
      console.log("Eligible for the loan");
    }
  }
}else{
  console.log("not eligible for the loan");
}

(age >= 21 && salary > 30000 && creditScore > 650)? console.log("Eligible for the loan"):console.log("not Eligible for the loan")
